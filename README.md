# ACSS
Actually Complete Solar System (ACSS) - SpaceFlight Simulator

How to install this pack:

- Copy any or all the ACSS folders under Custom Solar Systems to your SFS Custom Solar Systems folder
    - May differ depending on type of device you are using, i.e. Android/iPhone/Windows etc.
        - Windows: <install_location>\Spaceflight Simulator\Spaceflight Simulator Game\Spaceflight Simulator_Data
            - <install_location>... I have this installed through Steam (not sure if there's other ways to install)
              so by default for Steam the install location would be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common"
              you can check this location by going into Steam -> Settings -> Downloads -> Steam Library Folders
        - iPhone (using the "Files" app): On My iPhone -> Spaceflight Simulator -> Custom Solar Systems
            - NOTE: I use this app called "Kodex" to modify these files from my phone, just be sure to close down SFS
              before you try to save the file, otherwise your changes may not save because SFS has them open and locked
        - Android: Android\data\com.StefMorojna.SpaceflightSimulator\files\Custom Solar Systems\Example\Planet Data
            - But don't quote me on that one, I don't have an Android device to test with
              I'm getting this from what I see other users are posting and from the Planet Editor Tutorial on the 
              spaceflight-simulator.fandom.com wiki... https://spaceflight-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Planet_Editor_Tutorial
